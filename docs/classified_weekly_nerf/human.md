  - [FNeVR: Neural Volume Rendering for Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10340) | [code]
    > Face animation, one of the hottest topics in computer vision, has achieved a promising performance with the help of generative models. However, it remains a critical challenge to generate identity preserving and photo-realistic images due to the sophisticated motion deformation and complex facial detail modeling. To address these problems, we propose a Face Neural Volume Rendering (FNeVR) network to fully explore the potential of 2D motion warping and 3D volume rendering in a unified framework. In FNeVR, we design a 3D Face Volume Rendering (FVR) module to enhance the facial details for image rendering. Specifically, we first extract 3D information with a well-designed architecture, and then introduce an orthogonal adaptive ray-sampling module for efficient rendering. We also design a lightweight pose editor, enabling FNeVR to edit the facial pose in a simple yet effective way. Extensive experiments show that our FNeVR obtains the best overall quality and performance on widely used talking-head benchmarks.
  - [Human Performance Modeling and Rendering via Neural Animated Mesh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08468) | [code]
    > We have recently seen tremendous progress in the neural advances for photo-real human modeling and rendering. However, it's still challenging to integrate them into an existing mesh-based pipeline for downstream applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive neural approach for high-quality reconstruction, compression, and rendering of human performances from dense multi-view videos. Our core intuition is to bridge the traditional animated mesh workflow with a new class of highly efficient neural techniques. We first introduce a neural surface reconstructor for high-quality surface generation in minutes. It marries the implicit volumetric rendering of the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) with multi-resolution hash encoding. We further propose a hybrid neural tracker to generate animated meshes, which combines explicit non-rigid tracking with implicit dynamic deformation in a self-supervised framework. The former provides the coarse warping back into the canonical space, while the latter implicit one further predicts the displacements using the 4D hash encoding as in our reconstructor. Then, we discuss the rendering schemes using the obtained animated meshes, ranging from dynamic texturing to lumigraph rendering under various bandwidth settings. To strike an intricate balance between quality and bandwidth, we propose a hierarchical solution by first rendering 6 virtual views covering the performer and then conducting occlusion-aware neural texture blending. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of mesh-based applications and photo-realistic free-view experiences on various platforms, i.e., inserting virtual human performances into real environments through mobile AR or immersively watching talent shows with VR headsets.

  - [3DMM-RF: Convolutional Radiance Fields for 3D Face Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07366) | [code]
    > Facial 3D Morphable Models are a main computer vision subject with countless applications and have been highly optimized in the last two decades. The tremendous improvements of deep generative networks have created various possibilities for improving such models and have attracted wide interest. Moreover, the recent advances in neural radiance fields, are revolutionising novel-view synthesis of known scenes. In this work, we present a facial 3D Morphable Model, which exploits both of the above, and can accurately model a subject's identity, pose and expression and render it in arbitrary illumination. This is achieved by utilizing a powerful deep style-based generator to overcome two main weaknesses of neural radiance fields, their rigidity and rendering speed. We introduce a style-based generative network that synthesizes in one pass all and only the required rendering samples of a neural radiance field. We create a vast labelled synthetic dataset of facial renders, and train the network on these data, so that it can accurately model and generalize on facial identity, pose and appearance. Finally, we show that this model can accurately be fit to "in-the-wild" facial images of arbitrary pose and illumination, extract the facial characteristics, and be used to re-render the face in controllable conditions.
  - [Explicitly Controllable 3D-Aware Portrait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05434) | [code]
    > In contrast to the traditional avatar creation pipeline which is a costly process, contemporary generative approaches directly learn the data distribution from photographs. While plenty of works extend unconditional generative models and achieve some levels of controllability, it is still challenging to ensure multi-view consistency, especially in large poses. In this work, we propose a network that generates 3D-aware portraits while being controllable according to semantic parameters regarding pose, identity, expression and illumination. Our network uses neural scene representation to model 3D-aware portraits, whose generation is guided by a parametric face model that supports explicit control. While the latent disentanglement can be further enhanced by contrasting images with partially different attributes, there still exists noticeable inconsistency in non-face areas, e.g., hair and background, when animating expressions. Wesolve this by proposing a volume blending strategy in which we form a composite output by blending dynamic and static areas, with two parts segmented from the jointly learned semantic field. Our method outperforms prior arts in extensive experiments, producing realistic portraits with vivid expression in natural lighting when viewed from free viewpoints. It also demonstrates generalization ability to real images as well as out-of-domain data, showing great promise in real applications.

    > Recovering the geometry of a human head from a single image, while factorizing the materials and illumination is a severely ill-posed problem that requires prior information to be solved. Methods based on 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), and their combination with differentiable renderers, have shown promising results. However, the expressiveness of 3DMMs is limited, and they typically yield over-smoothed and identity-agnostic 3D shapes limited to the face region. Highly accurate full head reconstructions have recently been obtained with neural fields that parameterize the geometry using multilayer perceptrons. The versatility of these representations has also proved effective for disentangling geometry, materials and lighting. However, these methods require several tens of input images. In this paper, we introduce SIRA, a method which, from a single image, reconstructs human head avatars with high fidelity geometry and factorized lights and surface materials. Our key ingredients are two data-driven statistical models based on neural fields that resolve the ambiguities of single-view 3D surface reconstruction and appearance factorization. Experiments show that SIRA obtains state of the art results in 3D head reconstruction while at the same time it successfully disentangles the global illumination, and the diffuse and specular albedos. Furthermore, our reconstructions are amenable to physically-based appearance editing and head model relighting.
  - [MotionDiffuse: Text-Driven Human Motion Generation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.15001) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/mingyuan-zhang/MotionDiffuse)
    > Human motion modeling is important for many modern graphics applications, which typically require professional skills. In order to remove the skill barriers for laymen, recent motion generation methods can directly generate human motions conditioned on natural languages. However, it remains challenging to achieve diverse and fine-grained motion generation with various text inputs. To address this problem, we propose MotionDiffuse, the first diffusion model-based text-driven motion generation framework, which demonstrates several desired properties over existing methods. 1) Probabilistic Mapping. Instead of a deterministic language-motion mapping, MotionDiffuse generates motions through a series of denoising steps in which variations are injected. 2) Realistic Synthesis. MotionDiffuse excels at modeling complicated data distribution and generating vivid motion sequences. 3) Multi-Level Manipulation. MotionDiffuse responds to fine-grained instructions on body parts, and arbitrary-length motion synthesis with time-varied text prompts. Our experiments show MotionDiffuse outperforms existing SoTA methods by convincing margins on text-driven motion generation and action-conditioned motion generation. A qualitative analysis further demonstrates MotionDiffuse's controllability for comprehensive motion generation. Homepage: this https URL

  - [Dual-Space NeRF: Learning Animatable Avatars and Scene Lighting in Separate Spaces, 3DV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14851) | [code]
    > Modeling the human body in a canonical space is a common practice for capturing and animation. But when involving the neural radiance field (NeRF), learning a static NeRF in the canonical space is not enough because the lighting of the body changes when the person moves even though the scene lighting is constant. Previous methods alleviate the inconsistency of lighting by learning a per-frame embedding, but this operation does not generalize to unseen poses. Given that the lighting condition is static in the world space while the human body is consistent in the canonical space, we propose a dual-space NeRF that models the scene lighting and the human body with two MLPs in two separate spaces. To bridge these two spaces, previous methods mostly rely on the linear blend skinning (LBS) algorithm. However, the blending weights for LBS of a dynamic neural field are intractable and thus are usually memorized with another MLP, which does not generalize to novel poses. Although it is possible to borrow the blending weights of a parametric mesh such as SMPL, the interpolation operation introduces more artifacts. In this paper, we propose to use the barycentric mapping, which can directly generalize to unseen poses and surprisingly achieves superior results than LBS with neural blending weights. Quantitative and qualitative results on the Human3.6M and the ZJU-MoCap datasets show the effectiveness of our method.
  - [NerfCap: Human Performance Capture With Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, TVCG2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9870173) | [code]
    > This paper addresses the challenge of human performance capture from sparse multi-view or monocular videos. Given a template mesh of the performer, previous methods capture the human motion by non-rigidly registering the template mesh to images with 2D silhouettes or dense photometric alignment. However, the detailed surface deformation cannot be recovered from the silhouettes, while the photometric alignment suffers from instability caused by appearance variation in the videos. To solve these problems, we propose NerfCap, a novel performance capture method based on the dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) representation of the performer. Specifically, a canonical NeRF is initialized from the template geometry and registered to the video frames by optimizing the deformation field and the appearance model of the canonical NeRF. To capture both large body motion and detailed surface deformation, NerfCap combines linear blend skinning with embedded graph deformation. In contrast to the mesh-based methods that suffer from fixed topology and texture, NerfCap is able to flexibly capture complex geometry and appearance variation across the videos, and synthesize more photo-realistic images. In addition, NerfCap can be pre-trained end to end in a self-supervised manner by matching the synthesized videos with the input videos. Experimental results on various datasets show that NerfCap outperforms prior works in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and novel-view synthesis quality.

  - [Neural Novel Actor: Learning a Generalized Animatable Neural Representation for Human Actors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11905) | [code]
    > We propose a new method for learning a generalized animatable neural human representation from a sparse set of multi-view imagery of multiple persons. The learned representation can be used to synthesize novel view images of an arbitrary person from a sparse set of cameras, and further animate them with the user's pose control. While existing methods can either generalize to new persons or synthesize animations with user control, none of them can achieve both at the same time. We attribute this accomplishment to the employment of a 3D proxy for a shared multi-person human model, and further the warping of the spaces of different poses to a shared canonical pose space, in which we learn a neural field and predict the person- and pose-dependent deformations, as well as appearance with the features extracted from input images. To cope with the complexity of the large variations in body shapes, poses, and clothing deformations, we design our neural human model with disentangled geometry and appearance. Furthermore, we utilize the image features both at the spatial point and on the surface points of the 3D proxy for predicting person- and pose-dependent properties. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both tasks. The video and code are available at this https URL.

  - [Temporal View Synthesis of Dynamic Scenes through 3D Object Motion Estimation with Multi-Plane Images, ISMAR2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09463) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/NagabhushanSN95/DeCOMPnet)
    > The challenge of graphically rendering high frame-rate videos on low compute devices can be addressed through periodic prediction of future frames to enhance the user experience in virtual reality applications. This is studied through the problem of temporal view synthesis (TVS), where the goal is to predict the next frames of a video given the previous frames and the head poses of the previous and the next frames. In this work, we consider the TVS of dynamic scenes in which both the user and objects are moving. We design a framework that decouples the motion into user and object motion to effectively use the available user motion while predicting the next frames. We predict the motion of objects by isolating and estimating the 3D object motion in the past frames and then extrapolating it. We employ multi-plane images (MPI) as a 3D representation of the scenes and model the object motion as the 3D displacement between the corresponding points in the MPI representation. In order to handle the sparsity in MPIs while estimating the motion, we incorporate partial convolutions and masked correlation layers to estimate corresponding points. The predicted object motion is then integrated with the given user or camera motion to generate the next frame. Using a disocclusion infilling module, we synthesize the regions uncovered due to the camera and object motion. We develop a new synthetic dataset for TVS of dynamic scenes consisting of 800 videos at full HD resolution. We show through experiments on our dataset and the MPI Sintel dataset that our model outperforms all the competing methods in the literature.
  - [LoRD: Local 4D Implicit Representation for High-Fidelity Dynamic Human Modeling, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08622) | [code]
    > Recent progress in 4D implicit representation focuses on globally controlling the shape and motion with low dimensional latent vectors, which is prone to missing surface details and accumulating tracking error. While many deep local representations have shown promising results for 3D shape modeling, their 4D counterpart does not exist yet. In this paper, we fill this blank by proposing a novel Local 4D implicit Representation for Dynamic clothed human, named LoRD, which has the merits of both 4D human modeling and local representation, and enables high-fidelity reconstruction with detailed surface deformations, such as clothing wrinkles. Particularly, our key insight is to encourage the network to learn the latent codes of local part-level representation, capable of explaining the local geometry and temporal deformations. To make the inference at test-time, we first estimate the inner body skeleton motion to track local parts at each time step, and then optimize the latent codes for each part via auto-decoding based on different types of observed data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has strong capability for representing 4D human, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on practical applications, including 4D reconstruction from sparse points, non-rigid depth fusion, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
  - [Neural Capture of Animatable 3D Human from Monocular Video, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08728) | [code]
    > We present a novel paradigm of building an animatable 3D human representation from a monocular video input, such that it can be rendered in any unseen poses and views. Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rigged by a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous methods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information as additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when generalized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a good input embedding for querying dynamic NeRF: A good input embedding should define an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface mesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to embed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by a set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both position and relative distance information, our embedding defines a distance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To reduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D meshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly optimize NeRF and refine the initial mesh. Extensive experiments show our method can synthesize plausible human rendering results under unseen poses and views.

    > Neural representations have shown great promise in their ability to represent radiance and light fields while being very compact compared to the image set representation. However, current representations are not well suited for streaming as decoding can only be done at a single level of detail and requires downloading the entire neural network model. Furthermore, high-resolution light field networks can exhibit flickering and aliasing as neural networks are sampled without appropriate filtering. To resolve these issues, we present a progressive multi-scale light field network that encodes a light field with multiple levels of detail. Lower levels of detail are encoded using fewer neural network weights enabling progressive streaming and reducing rendering time. Our progressive multi-scale light field network addresses aliasing by encoding smaller anti-aliased representations at its lower levels of detail. Additionally, per-pixel level of detail enables our representation to support dithered transitions and foveated rendering.

    > We present Neural Strands, a novel learning framework for modeling accurate hair geometry and appearance from multi-view image inputs. The learned hair model can be rendered in real-time from any viewpoint with high-fidelity view-dependent effects. Our model achieves intuitive shape and style control unlike volumetric counterparts. To enable these properties, we propose a novel hair representation based on a neural scalp texture that encodes the geometry and appearance of individual strands at each texel location. Furthermore, we introduce a novel neural rendering framework based on rasterization of the learned hair strands. Our neural rendering is strand-accurate and anti-aliased, making the rendering view-consistent and photorealistic. Combining appearance with a multi-view geometric prior, we enable, for the first time, the joint learning of appearance and explicit hair geometry from a multi-view setup. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of fidelity and efficiency for various hairstyles.

    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [PVA: Pixel-aligned Volumetric Avatars, CVPR2021](https://volumetric-avatars.github.io/) | [code]
    > Acquisition and rendering of photorealistic human heads is a highly challenging research problem of particular importance for virtual telepresence. Currently, the highest quality is achieved by volumetric approaches trained in a person-specific manner on multi-view data. These models better represent fine structure, such as hair, compared to simpler mesh-based models. Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters. While such architectures achieve impressive rendering quality, they can not easily be extended to the multi-identity setting. In this paper, we devise a novel approach for predicting volumetric avatars of the human head given just a small number of inputs. We enable generalization across identities by a novel parameterization that combines neural radiance fields with local, pixel-aligned features extracted directly from the inputs, thus side-stepping the need for very deep or complex networks. Our approach is trained in an end-to-end manner solely based on a photometric rerendering loss without requiring explicit 3D supervision.We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing state of the art in terms of quality and is able to generate faithful facial expressions in a multi-identity setting.
  - [Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Human Body Modeling, ICCV2021](https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/zju3dv/animatable_nerf)
    > This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods. The code will be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/animatable_nerf/.

    > We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images. While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose- and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses. Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized results.

    > This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a human performer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view dataset named ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments on ZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.

In this work, we propose to pretrain the weights of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which implicitly models the volumetric density and colors, with a meta-learning framework using a light stage portrait dataset. To improve the generalization to unseen faces, we train the MLP in the canonical coordinate space approximated by 3D face morphable models. We quantitatively evaluate the method using controlled captures and demonstrate the generalization to real portrait images, showing favorable results against state-of-the-arts.

    > While deep learning reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline with feed-forward networks, generative models are required to recover fine alignment via iterative refinement. Unfortunately, the existing models are usually hand-crafted or learned in controlled conditions, only applicable to limited domains. We propose a method to learn a generative neural body model from unlabelled monocular videos by extending Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We equip them with a skeleton to apply to time-varying and articulated motion. A key insight is that implicit models require the inverse of the forward kinematics used in explicit surface models. Our reparameterization defines spatial latent variables relative to the pose of body parts and thereby overcomes ill-posed inverse operations with an overparameterization. This enables learning volumetric body shape and appearance from scratch while jointly refining the articulated pose; all without ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape on the input videos. When used for novel-view-synthesis and motion capture, our neural model improves accuracy on diverse datasets. Project website: this https URL .
  - [Learning Compositional Radiance Fields of Dynamic Human Heads, CVPR2021(oral)](https://ziyanw1.github.io/hybrid_nerf/) | [code]
    > Photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans is an important ability for telepresence systems, virtual shopping, synthetic data generation, and more. Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation code. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of dynamic human heads and the upper body.

    > Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.
