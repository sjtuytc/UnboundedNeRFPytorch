  - [RelPose: Predicting Probabilistic Relative Rotation for Single Objects in the Wild, ECCV2022](https://jasonyzhang.com/relpose/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/jasonyzhang/relpose)
    > We describe a data-driven method for inferring the camera viewpoints given multiple images of an arbitrary object. This task is a core component of classic geometric pipelines such as SfM and SLAM, and also serves as a vital pre-processing requirement for contemporary neural approaches (e.g. NeRF) to object reconstruction and view synthesis. In contrast to existing correspondence-driven methods that do not perform well given sparse views, we propose a top-down prediction based approach for estimating camera viewpoints. Our key technical insight is the use of an energy-based formulation for representing distributions over relative camera rotations, thus allowing us to explicitly represent multiple camera modes arising from object symmetries or views. Leveraging these relative predictions, we jointly estimate a consistent set of camera rotations from multiple images. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art SfM and SLAM methods given sparse images on both seen and unseen categories. Further, our probabilistic approach significantly outperforms directly regressing relative poses, suggesting that modeling multimodality is important for coherent joint reconstruction. We demonstrate that our system can be a stepping stone toward in-the-wild reconstruction from multi-view datasets. The project page with code and videos can be found at this https URL.

  - [PRIF: Primary Ray-based Implicit Function](https://research.google/pubs/pub51556/) | [code]
    > We introduce a new implicit shape representation called Primary Ray-based Implicit Function (PRIF). In contrast to most existing approaches based on the signed distance function (SDF) which handles spatial locations, our representation operates on oriented rays. Specifically, PRIF is formulated to directly produce the surface hit point of a given input ray, without the expensive sphere-tracing operations, hence enabling efficient shape extraction and differentiable rendering. We demonstrate that neural networks trained to encode PRIF achieve successes in various tasks including single shape representation, category-wise shape generation, shape completion from sparse or noisy observations, inverse rendering for camera pose estimation, and neural rendering with color.

  - [ObjectFusion: Accurate object-level SLAM with neural object priors, Graphical Models, Volume 123, September 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524070322000418) | [code]
    > Previous object-level Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) approaches still fail to create high quality object-oriented 3D map in an efficient way. The main challenges come from how to represent the object shape effectively and how to apply such object representation to accurate online camera tracking efficiently. In this paper, we provide ObjectFusion as a novel object-level SLAM in static scenes which efficiently creates object-oriented 3D map with high-quality object reconstruction, by leveraging neural object priors. We propose a neural object representation with only a single encoder–decoder network to effectively express the object shape across various categories, which benefits high quality reconstruction of object instance. More importantly, we propose to convert such neural object representation as precise measurements to jointly optimize the object shape, object pose and camera pose for the final accurate 3D object reconstruction. With extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world RGB-D datasets, we show that our ObjectFusion outperforms previous approaches, with better object reconstruction quality, using much less memory footprint, and in a more efficient way, especially at the object level.
  - [Neural Density-Distance Fields, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14455) | [***``[code]``***](https://ueda0319.github.io/neddf/)
    > The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable. Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g., SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand, distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke, which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field. Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore, the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is available at this https URL.
  - [ShAPO: Implicit Representations for Multi-Object Shape, Appearance, and Pose Optimization, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13691) | [***``[code]``***](https://zubair-irshad.github.io/projects/ShAPO.html)
    > Our method studies the complex task of object-centric 3D understanding from a single RGB-D observation. As it is an ill-posed problem, existing methods suffer from low performance for both 3D shape and 6D pose and size estimation in complex multi-object scenarios with occlusions. We present ShAPO, a method for joint multi-object detection, 3D textured reconstruction, 6D object pose and size estimation. Key to ShAPO is a single-shot pipeline to regress shape, appearance and pose latent codes along with the masks of each object instance, which is then further refined in a sparse-to-dense fashion. A novel disentangled shape and appearance database of priors is first learned to embed objects in their respective shape and appearance space. We also propose a novel, octree-based differentiable optimization step, allowing us to further improve object shape, pose and appearance simultaneously under the learned latent space, in an analysis-by-synthesis fashion. Our novel joint implicit textured object representation allows us to accurately identify and reconstruct novel unseen objects without having access to their 3D meshes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method, trained on simulated indoor scenes, accurately regresses the shape, appearance and pose of novel objects in the real-world with minimal fine-tuning. Our method significantly out-performs all baselines on the NOCS dataset with an 8% absolute improvement in mAP for 6D pose estimation.
  - [GAUDI: A Neural Architect for Immersive 3D Scene Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13751) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/apple/ml-gaudi)
    > We introduce GAUDI, a generative model capable of capturing the distribution of complex and realistic 3D scenes that can be rendered immersively from a moving camera. We tackle this challenging problem with a scalable yet powerful approach, where we first optimize a latent representation that disentangles radiance fields and camera poses. This latent representation is then used to learn a generative model that enables both unconditional and conditional generation of 3D scenes. Our model generalizes previous works that focus on single objects by removing the assumption that the camera pose distribution can be shared across samples. We show that GAUDI obtains state-of-the-art performance in the unconditional generative setting across multiple datasets and allows for conditional generation of 3D scenes given conditioning variables like sparse image observations or text that describes the scene.
  - [AlignSDF: Pose-Aligned Signed Distance Fields for Hand-Object Reconstruction, ECCV2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12909) | [***``[code]``***](https://zerchen.github.io/projects/alignsdf.html)
    > Recent work achieved impressive progress towards joint reconstruction of hands and manipulated objects from monocular color images. Existing methods focus on two alternative representations in terms of either parametric meshes or signed distance fields (SDFs). On one side, parametric models can benefit from prior knowledge at the cost of limited shape deformations and mesh resolutions. Mesh models, hence, may fail to precisely reconstruct details such as contact surfaces of hands and objects. SDF-based methods, on the other side, can represent arbitrary details but are lacking explicit priors. In this work we aim to improve SDF models using priors provided by parametric representations. In particular, we propose a joint learning framework that disentangles the pose and the shape. We obtain hand and object poses from parametric models and use them to align SDFs in 3D space. We show that such aligned SDFs better focus on reconstructing shape details and improve reconstruction accuracy both for hands and objects. We evaluate our method and demonstrate significant improvements over the state of the art on the challenging ObMan and DexYCB benchmarks.

  - [NeRF in the Wild: Neural Radiance Fields for Unconstrained Photo Collections, CVPR2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02268) | [code]
    > We present a learning-based method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes using only unstructured collections of in-the-wild photographs. We build on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which uses the weights of a multilayer perceptron to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.
  - [Ha-NeRF: Hallucinated Neural Radiance Fields in the Wild, CVPR2022](https://rover-xingyu.github.io/Ha-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/rover-xingyu/Ha-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has recently gained popularity for its impressive novel view synthesis ability. This paper studies the problem of hallucinated NeRF: i.e., recovering a realistic NeRF at a different time of day from a group of tourism images. Existing solutions adopt NeRF with a controllable appearance embedding to render novel views under various conditions, but they cannot render view-consistent images with an unseen appearance. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end framework for constructing a hallucinated NeRF, dubbed as Ha-NeRF. Specifically, we propose an appearance hallucination module to handle time-varying appearances and transfer them to novel views. Considering the complex occlusions of tourism images, we introduce an anti-occlusion module to decompose the static subjects for visibility accurately. Experimental results on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections demonstrate that our method can hallucinate the desired appearances and render occlusion-free images from different views.
  - [Nerfies: Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12948) | [code]
    > We present the first method capable of photorealistically reconstructing deformable scenes using photos/videos captured casually from mobile phones. Our approach augments neural radiance fields (NeRF) by optimizing an additional continuous volumetric deformation field that warps each observed point into a canonical 5D NeRF. We observe that these NeRF-like deformation fields are prone to local minima, and propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method for coordinate-based models that allows for more robust optimization. By adapting principles from geometry processing and physical simulation to NeRF-like models, we propose an elastic regularization of the deformation field that further improves robustness. We show that our method can turn casually captured selfie photos/videos into deformable NeRF models that allow for photorealistic renderings of the subject from arbitrary viewpoints, which we dub "nerfies." We evaluate our method by collecting time-synchronized data using a rig with two mobile phones, yielding train/validation images of the same pose at different viewpoints. We show that our method faithfully reconstructs non-rigidly deforming scenes and reproduces unseen views with high fidelity.
  - [Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields for Monocular 4D Facial Avatar Reconstruction, CVPR2021](https://gafniguy.github.io/4D-Facial-Avatars/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars)
    > We present dynamic neural radiance fields for modeling the appearance and dynamics of a human face. Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoint or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.
  - [Neural Articulated Radiance Field, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03110) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/nogu-atsu/NARF#code)
    > We present Neural Articulated Radiance Field (NARF), a novel deformable 3D representation for articulated objects learned from images. While recent advances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models of complex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulated objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representation of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposed method is efficient and can generalize well to novel poses.
  - [Neural Actor: Neural Free-view Synthesis of Human Actors with Pose Control, SIGSIGGRAPH Asia 2021](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/NeuralActor/) | [***``[code]``***](https://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~lliu/projects/NeuralActor/)
    > We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images. While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose- and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses. Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized results.
  - [iNeRF: Inverting Neural Radiance Fields for Pose Estimation, IROS2021](http://yenchenlin.me/inerf/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/yenchenlin/iNeRF-public)
    > We present iNeRF, a framework that performs pose estimation by “inverting” a trained Neural Radiance Field(NeRF). NeRFs have been shown to be remarkably effective for the task of view synthesis — synthesizing photorealisticnovel views of real-world scenes or objects. In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis with NeRF for 6DoF pose estimation – given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3Dmodel. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from an already-trained NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes ofrays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional trainingdata for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can be combinedwith feature-based pose initialization. The approach outperforms all other RGB-based methods relying on syntheticdata on LineMOD.
  - [A-NeRF: Surface-free Human 3D Pose Refinement via Neural Rendering, NeurIPS2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06199) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/LemonATsu/A-NeRF)
    > While deep learning reshaped the classical motion capture pipeline with feed-forward networks, generative models are required to recover fine alignment via iterative refinement. Unfortunately, the existing models are usually hand-crafted or learned in controlled conditions, only applicable to limited domains. We propose a method to learn a generative neural body model from unlabelled monocular videos by extending Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). We equip them with a skeleton to apply to time-varying and articulated motion. A key insight is that implicit models require the inverse of the forward kinematics used in explicit surface models. Our reparameterization defines spatial latent variables relative to the pose of body parts and thereby overcomes ill-posed inverse operations with an overparameterization. This enables learning volumetric body shape and appearance from scratch while jointly refining the articulated pose; all without ground truth labels for appearance, pose, or 3D shape on the input videos. When used for novel-view-synthesis and motion capture, our neural model improves accuracy on diverse datasets. Project website: this https URL .
  - [NeRF--: Neural Radiance Fields Without Known Camera Parameters](https://nerfmm.active.vision/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/ActiveVisionLab/nerfmm)
    > Considering the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from only a set of 2D images, we simplify the training process of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) on forward-facing scenes by removing the requirement of known or pre-computed camera parameters, including both intrinsics and 6DoF poses. To this end, we propose NeRF−−, with three contributions: First, we show that the camera parameters can be jointly optimised as learnable parameters with NeRF training, through a photometric reconstruction; Second, to benchmark the camera parameter estimation and the quality of novel view renderings, we introduce a new dataset of path-traced synthetic scenes, termed as Blender Forward-Facing Dataset (BLEFF); Third, we conduct extensive analyses to understand the training behaviours under various camera motions, and show that in most scenarios, the joint optimisation pipeline can recover accurate camera parameters and achieve comparable novel view synthesis quality as those trained with COLMAP pre-computed camera parameters.
  - [Implicit Mapping and Positioning in Real-Time, ICCV2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12352) | [code]
    > We show for the first time that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can serve as the only scene representation in a real-time SLAM system for a handheld RGB-D camera. Our network is trained in live operation without prior data, building a dense, scene-specific implicit 3D model of occupancy and colour which is also immediately used for tracking.
  - [NICE-SLAM  Neural Implicit Scalable Encoding for SLAM, CVPR2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12130) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/cvg/nice-slam)
    > Neural implicit representations have recently shown encouraging results in various domains, including promising progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Nevertheless, existing methods produce over-smoothed scene reconstructions and have difficulty scaling up to large scenes. These limitations are mainly due to their simple fully-connected network architecture that does not incorporate local information in the observations. In this paper, we present NICE-SLAM, a dense SLAM system that incorporates multi-level local information by introducing a hierarchical scene representation. Optimizing this representation with pre-trained geometric priors enables detailed reconstruction on large indoor scenes. Compared to recent neural implicit SLAM systems, our approach is more scalable, efficient, and robust. Experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate competitive results of NICE-SLAM in both mapping and tracking quality.
  - [GNeRF: GAN-based Neural Radiance Field without Posed Camera, ICCV2021(oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15606) | [code]
    > We introduce GNeRF, a framework to marry Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) reconstruction for the complex scenarios with unknown and even randomly initialized camera poses. Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.
  - [BARF: Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021(oral)](https://chenhsuanlin.bitbucket.io/bundle-adjusting-NeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/chenhsuanlin/bundle-adjusting-NeRF)
    > Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently gained a surge of interest within the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement of accurate camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses — the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show that naively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.
  - [Self-Calibrating Neural Radiance Fields, ICCV2021](https://postech-cvlab.github.io/SCNeRF/) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/SCNeRF)
    > In this work, we propose a camera self-calibration algorithm for generic cameras with arbitrary non-linear distortions. We jointly learn the geometry of the scene and the accurate camera parameters without any calibration objects. Our camera model consists a pinhole model, radial distortion, and a generic noise model that can learn arbitrary non-linear camera distortions. While traditional self-calibration algorithms mostly rely on geometric constraints, we additionally incorporate photometric consistency. This requires learning the geometry of the scene and we use Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). We also propose a new geometric loss function, viz., projected ray distance loss, to incorporate geometric consistency for complex non-linear camera models. We validate our approach on standard real image datasets and demonstrate our model can learn the camera intrinsics and extrinsics (pose) from scratch without COLMAP initialization. Also, we show that learning accurate camera models in differentiable manner allows us to improves PSNR over NeRF. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method is applicable to variants of NeRF. In addition, we use a set of images captured with a fish-eye lens to demonstrate that learning camera model jointly improves the performance significantly over the COLMAP initialization.
  - [Neural Scene Graphs for Dynamic Scenes, CVPR2021(oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10379) | [***``[code]``***](https://github.com/princeton-computational-imaging/neural-scene-graphs)
    > Recent implicit neural rendering methods have demonstrated that it is possible to learn accurate view synthesis for complex scenes by predicting their volumetric density and color supervised solely by a set of RGB images. However, existing methods are restricted to learning efficient representations of static scenes that encode all scene objects into a single neural network, and lack the ability to represent dynamic scenes and decompositions into individual scene objects. In this work, we present the first neural rendering method that decomposes dynamic scenes into scene graphs. We propose a learned scene graph representation, which encodes object transformation and radiance, to efficiently render novel arrangements and views of the scene. To this end, we learn implicitly encoded scenes, combined with a jointly learned latent representation to describe objects with a single implicit function. We assess the proposed method on synthetic and real automotive data, validating that our approach learns dynamic scenes -- only by observing a video of this scene -- and allows for rendering novel photo-realistic views of novel scene compositions with unseen sets of objects at unseen poses.
